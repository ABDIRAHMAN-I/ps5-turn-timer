# 🎮 PS5 Turn Timer

This project started as a simple Bash script I wrote while looking after my nieces as they took turns playing on the PS5. I was manually tracking their 6-minute playtimes and thought — why not automate it?

I then turned the idea into a web app to make it easier and more fun for them (and me 😄).
